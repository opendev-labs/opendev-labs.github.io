### The Sovereign Intelligence Ecosystem

opendev-labs is a high-fidelity, distributed infrastructure platform designed for orchestrating advanced intelligence and secure, programmable reality. It provides a unified stack of tools including **LamaDB**, **Q-Cloud**, and **SyncStack**.

## Core Ecosystem
- **[LamaDB](https://github.com/opendev-labs/LamaDB)**: The Unified Intelligence Protocol for distributed state.
- **Q-Cloud**: Quantum-ready serverless infrastructure with sub-atomic latency.
- **SyncStack**: Distributed state synchronization layer for high-pressure clusters.
- **Dashboard**: A high-fidelity orchestration engine for deploying intelligence.

## Vision
To provide engineers with the sovereign tools needed to build, scale, and secure the next generation of intelligent systems.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vite + React + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion
- **Architecture**: Vercel-style minimal aesthetics with high-fidelity micro-interactions.
- **Intelligence**: Real-time synchronization via the LamaDB protocol.
